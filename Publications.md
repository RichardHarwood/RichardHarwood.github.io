# Plant Physiology Papers 

<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360138518302103"> Embracing 3D Complexity in Leaf Carbon–Water Exchange </a> <br />
<img  src="/img/TIPS_JPG.jpg" width="200" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto" />
My first ever paper! In this opinion piece I contributed a 3D reconstruction of a wheat mesophyll cell and contributed to the discussion on considering 3D anatomy when trying to better understand mesophyll conductance.

<a href="https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.16219"> Cell and chloroplast anatomical features are poorly estimated from 2D cross-sections </a> <br />
<img  src="/img/newphyt_fig_JPG.jpg" width="200" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto" />
My first ever lead author paper! Here we produced a large amount of cell and chloroplast 3D models and compared the results to established methods used to infer 3D surface area and volume from 2D cross sections. We showed that 2D models often perform poorly and discuss the benefits of moving towards a 3D based approach.

<a href="https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.16733"> No evidence of homeostatic regulation of leaf temperature in Eucalyptus parramattensis trees: integration of CO2 flux and oxygen isotope methodologies </a> <br />
<img  src="/img/WTC.jpg" width="200" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto" />
An awesome collaboration with Western Sydney University using whole tree chambers! Here I measured the oxygen isotopes of whole tree chambers and the surrounding atmosphere for 80+ days. Using regular measurements of trunk diameter, I was able to isolate trunk cellulose from specific growth periods. The oxygen isotope ratios of the cellulose was measured and compared to online measurements of leaf temperature to test the accuracy of cellulose as a record of ambient temperature and relative humidity during periods of carbon assimilation.

<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pce.14079"> Understanding airspace in leaves: 3D anatomy and directional tortuosity </a> <br />
<img  src="/img/PCE.png" width="200" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto" />
An awesome collaboration with Guillaume Théroux-Rancourt! Here we used carbon isotopes to estimate mesophyll conductance and SBF-SEM to capture cell and airspace properties of 4 different eucalyptus species. This paper was about quantifying the airspace and relating imaging to experimental data. We showed that when the airspace in leaves is heterogeneous previous assumptions fail.

<a href="https://academic.oup.com/aobpla/article/15/3/plad033/7190199"> Creating a virtual leaf</a> <br />
<img  src="/img/aobp.jpeg" width="200" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto" />
When I was wrapping up my thesis, I wrote a short discussion section called “Creating a virtual leaf”. When AOBP promoted a special issue for “Emerging voices in botany” I immediately thought of that part of my thesis that I loved writing but didn’t have the time to polish. Since my thesis there had also been some incredible 3D leaf models published so it gave me an opportunity to explore those as well.

# Bioimage Analysis Papers 
<a href="https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/embj.2021109032"> The blood vasculature instructs lymphatic patterning in a SOX7-dependent manner </a> <br />
<img  src="/img/smfish.PNG" width="200"  style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto" />
In this project I developed a bespoke image analysis pipeline to analyze Vegfc transcript using single-molecule FISH in vivo.

# Scientific Outreach Papers 
<a href="https://futurumcareers.com/3d-images-of-leaves-a-photo-shoot-we-should-all-be-looking-at"> 3D images of leaves: a photo shoot we should all be looking at </a> <br />
<img  src="/img/3D-reconstruction-of-a-chickpea-stomata.jpg" width="200" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto" />
An outreach article with Margaret Barbour that uses our 3D imaging data to inspire students to get into plant science and combat “plant blindness”. For this article I created a 3D model of chickpea leaf that could be 3D printed!
